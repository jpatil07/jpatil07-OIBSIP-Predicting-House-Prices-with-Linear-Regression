Project: Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression
This project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression to predict house prices based on various features using a dataset of housing prices.

Key Steps:
Data Exploration: Loaded the dataset and explored its structure, identifying missing values and generating summary statistics.
Data Cleaning:
Handled missing values in both numeric and categorical columns.
Converted categorical 'yes'/'no' columns into numeric values.
Feature Selection: Selected features and target variables for model training.
Data Preprocessing: Applied scaling for numeric features and one-hot encoding for categorical features.
Model Building: Used a Linear Regression model to predict house prices.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance with Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared values.
Visualization: Plotted:
Actual vs predicted prices
Residual plot
Distribution of residuals
Model Coefficients: Analyzed the impact of each feature on the predicted house price.
Tools & Libraries:
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Model: Linear Regression from Scikit-learn
